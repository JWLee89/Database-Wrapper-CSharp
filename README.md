# Database-Wrapper-CSharp
A simple database wrapper written in C# to enable users to user various types of databases in the .Net framework. In order to create a concrete implementation of your database connector, all you need to do is extend the base class and define the abstract methods. 

The abstract methods are used to define certain objects that are specific to the database such as the connection string. 

The following concrete implementations are available as of now.

* Postgresql
* Oracle DB
* My Sql
